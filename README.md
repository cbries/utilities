This repository includes an uncategorized list of applications/tools which support my dialy keep-alive trying during the handling of computer complexity.

- BitStuffQt: a tool for showing some information about Bit/Byte manipulations (e.g. shifting, inverting, etc.)
- QtGameOfLifeGL: a OpenGL-based simulation of Conway's "Game of Life", see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
- Message Passing Interface: examples of MPI usage
- sdlpaint: A "paint" application which is based on Simple Direct Layer (SDL) graphics routines
- Guestbook.fm: A simple PHP-based guestbook with Captcha functionality, and CRUD.
- 1filer: Small single application implemented in single files, i.e. any file is a standalone application.

- ...more tools are in progress!
