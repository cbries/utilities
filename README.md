# Utilities by Christian Benjamin Ries

This repository includes a uncategorized list of applications/tools which support my dialy keep-alive trying during the handling of computer complexity.

- BitStuffQt: a tool for showing some information about Bit/Byte manipulations (e.g. shifting, inverting, etc.)
- QtGameOfLifeGL: a OpenGL-based simulation of Conway's "Game of Life", see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

- ...more tools are in progress!
