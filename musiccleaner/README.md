# Input/*.mp3 to Output/*.mp3

Recently I found some mp3 files whiche are -- I guess -- downloaded from Youtube streams. Some of theses "produced" mp3 files are secured by a messy and annoying approach. At the beginning of the mp3 streams their is something like a barrier and old or not technical high-tech mp3 player will cancel playback on these barriers.

A simple way for avoiding stopping playback is to copy the full mp3 file by use of ffmpeg.

## Installation

Just download the repository. Additionally you have to install cygwin.

## How to use?

Provide any mp3 file in `Input/`.

Double-click `ConvertAnyMP3inInput.bat` and wait for the resulting files which are created in `Output/`.
