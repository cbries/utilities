Help #1 - enable AT mode
If it has a small button above the EN/KEY/WAKE UP pin, disconnected Vcc, press and hold that button, connect Vcc and it the LED in the module should blink slowly and allow you to enter AT codes.

Help #2 - Schematic
HC-05 GND          --- Arduino GND Pin
HC-05 VCC (5V)     --- Arduino 5V
HC-05 TX           --- Arduino Pin 10 (soft RX)
HC-05 RX           --- Arduino Pin11 (soft TX)
HC-05 Key (PIN 34) --- Arduino Pin 9 (can be called "EN" sometimes)

Help #3 - Some AT commands
(remove double quotes from AT command)
To return HC-05 to mfg. default settings: "AT+ORGL"
To get version of your HC-05 enter: "AT+VERSION?"
To change device name from the default HC-05 to let's say MYBLUE enter: "AT+NAME=MYBLUE"
To change default security code from 1234 to 2987 enter: "AT+PSWD=2987"
To change HC-05 baud rate from default 9600 to 115200, 1 stop bit, 0 parity enter: "AT+UART=115200,1,0"
